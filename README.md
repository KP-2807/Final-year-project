Sea channel modeling for underwater communication and navigation

Abstract: 
Water data communication is a potential technology to realize underwater 
communication. The experiment of underwater data communication in the 
laboratory is different from that in the real water environment because the physical 
scale is limited. Although since recent several decades, artificial scattering agents 
are used to recreate underwater data communication through water channels under 
different communication medium conditions, but the similarity between 
experimental water and natural water is not reliable, such as the similarity in 
frequency domain characteristics. 
  In this project, several kinds of agents are evaluated to change the coefficients 
of experimental water precisely. Then, as criterion for the reliability of water 
recreation, the frequency domain characteristic of data communication through 
water channel in experimental water is measured and compared. Also proposed with 
GPS location to track the ship via the water communication. The results show that 
the type and particle size of the agents will significantly affect its water properties, 
and the frequency domain component of the water communication signal will be 
affected by the agents concentration.by having a separate tx and ox module in the 
water between the modules we can transmit the sea researcherâ€™s biomedical 
conditions and interactions to the monitoring end available on the ship.
